# Survival of the Fittest

Survival of the Fittest is a game about hitting the slots until you've earned enough bananas to fill your grubby little pockets. This game is responsive on all devices. This is a casual game with a "nature" theme. While many of us may not be raging gambling addicts, we can still dare to dream. Come spin the wheels of fate!
